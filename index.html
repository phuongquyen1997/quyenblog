                <p>Language is the main key to connect everyone in the world. A new ability of a new language means that you have one more world. Therefore, I want to learn more to be able to explore more new things, more new culture. Now I can speak Japanese, English and a little bit of Chinese. I hope I can make this list as long as possible.</p>

                <p>After long working-hours, traveling to a brand new land is a worthy experience. Through travel, I can prove everthing I have read in the book or I have seen on the Internet to be true. Also, the best thing of travel is not just the journey but the way I and my friends arrange together about the trip always excites me.</p>

                <p>There is nothing better than relaxing with your favorite music when you have had to endure your boss or your clients for a long time. Trust me!!! It is said that music can heal every kind of soul no matter how dry it is. And it is truly no doubt. If you do not believe me, let's try hearing some instrumental music after having to suffer from one of the worst day ever. You will understand what I mean right away.</p>

                    <h4>Programming</h4>
                    <p>Up to now, I have been always thinking that programming is something impossible for me (even now). But I want to challenge myself more so I decided to take a course in coding, beginning with HTML/CSS. Of all fields in IT, I am specially interested in working with websites. So, my next step is to try learning JavaScript (front-end) and PHP (back-end).</p>
